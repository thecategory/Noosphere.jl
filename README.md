# Noosphere.jl

Library for accessing the [Global Conciousness Project](https://noosphere.princeton.edu/index.html) data in [Julia](https://julialang.org/).

# Motivation

The goal is find correlation with [DuckDuckGo News Results API](https://serpapi.com/duckduckgo-news-results) events with significant GCP network variance, to make possible their rationale less [anecdotal](https://global-mind.org/papers/pdf/GCP.Corona.edgescience.fin.pdf).
